<h1>The Timeline of the JPEG Image</h1>
<p>
There is a small amount of contention as to the exact year that the International Standard for Organisation (ISO) 
set about creating a standard for digital images. Adobe (2022) claim that they started in 1986, whereas the Encyclopedia Britannica (2022) 
claim they started in 1983. However, regardless of when they began trying to standardise digital photos, it is documented that JPEG, 
an acronym for Joint Photographic Experts Group, was created in 1986 (Adobe, 2022; Encyclopedia Britannica, 2022). 
</p>
<h1>Functions of JPEG Images</h1>
<p>
  On top of the ease that comes with having a standard form of digital image, 
  being able to share and use them with ease, JPEG images had to be able to be displayed on the computer screens of the 1980’s, 
  which were text only (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2022). 
  JPEG images use what is known as lossy compression to average out colour variation on a level that the human eye, for the most part, 
  has trouble detecting (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2022). 
  It is possible that the file compression can force images to lose detail and quality (Adobe, 2022).
</p>

<h1>JPEG Compression Steps</h1>
<ol>
   <li> Conversion: Converts the base RGB colour image into a luminance and chrominance images to determine brightness and colour levels, respectively.
   </li>
   <li> Spatial Subsampling: When the image is in its simple form of luminance and chrominance, it’s YCC form, the spatial information of the image is separated as most of that information comes from the luminance levels. 
       Having the low spatial information of the chrominance images are vital for the compression process. 
	   The subsampling process allows for the chrominance images to be halved without major loss of image resolution, unless viewed at high magnification.
   </li>
   <li> Transformation: The transformation step takes the information from the spatial subsampling stage and accounts for small sections of the image where there is little contrast. 
        The JPEG members created a mathematical formula called the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to reduce digital information over the low contrast areas.
   </li>
   <li>Quantization: Quantization is the step in which the compression of the image becomes irreversible in terms of loss in detail. 
       While the DCT follows a mathematical formula to compress the image, quantization scales the DCT coefficients by a factor dictated by the user.
	</li>
	<li> Coding: Once the image has been transformed and put through the quantization process, it is ready to be transcribed into code to be transmitted digitally. 
	     To ensure that the level of coding for the image to be as small as possible, Huffman coding is used to represent the DCT coefficients.
    </li>
</ol>

           <p>
             Short for “portable network graphics”, was created in 1996 as an open standard to replace GIF. 
             It creates lossless, portable, compressed, bit-mapped images. 
			 It supports Indexed colour, grayscale and RGB colour as well as opacity and gamma correction.

         <h3>TIFF - .tiff / .tif</h3>
  
           <p>
		     Short for tagged image file format, it was created in 1986 by the Aldus Corporation (now absorbed into Adobe Inc) 
		     to create a common file used for scanned images (i.e., documents). 
		     It is a lossless compressed image file with RGB and CMYK support for up to 32 bits per colour component which in turn makes it ideal for printing, 
		     however it does take up more space as a result.

			   Short for High Efficiency Image Format, it is the file format given to Apple devices that is used when taking photos. 
			   It was created by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) in 2015.
			   It is an alternative to JPEG that uses old and modern compression to shrink file format to storage sizes below JPEG, whilst keeping similar image quality.
