<h1>The Timeline of the JPEG Image</h1>
<p>
There is a small amount of contention as to the exact year that the International Standard for Organisation (ISO) 
set about creating a standard for digital images. Adobe (2022) claim that they started in 1986, whereas the Encyclopedia Britannica (2022) 
claim they started in 1983. However, regardless of when they began trying to standardise digital photos, it is documented that JPEG, 
an acronym for Joint Photographic Experts Group, was created in 1986 (Adobe, 2022; Encyclopedia Britannica, 2022). 
</p>
<h1>Functions of JPEG Images</h1>
<p>
  On top of the ease that comes with having a standard form of digital image, 
  being able to share and use them with ease, JPEG images had to be able to be displayed on the computer screens of the 1980’s, 
  which were text only (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2022). 
  JPEG images use what is known as lossy compression to average out colour variation on a level that the human eye, for the most part, 
  has trouble detecting (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2022). 
  It is possible that the file compression can force images to lose detail and quality (Adobe, 2022).

           <p>
             Short for “portable network graphics”, was created in 1996 as an open standard to replace GIF. 
             It creates lossless, portable, compressed, bit-mapped images. 
			 It supports Indexed colour, grayscale and RGB colour as well as opacity and gamma correction.

         <h3>TIFF -.tiff / .tif</h3>
  
           <p>
		     Short for tagged image file format, it was created in 1986 by the Aldus Corporation (now absorbed into Adobe Inc) 
		     to create a common file used for scanned images (i.e., documents). 
		     It is a lossless compressed image file with RGB and CMYK support for up to 32 bits per colour component which in turn makes it ideal for printing, 
		     however it does take up more space as a result.

			   Short for High Efficiency Image Format, it is the file format given to Apple devices that is used when taking photos. 
			   It was created by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) in 2015.
			   It is an alternative to JPEG that uses old and modern compression to shrink file format to storage sizes below JPEG, whilst keeping similar image quality.

		      <p>
			     Short for Microsoft Windows Bitmap format, 
				 BMP is a raster graphics image format designed to store bitmap digital images independently of display devices. 
				 Created in 1995 by Microsoft, it is a large, raw, high quality image format that supports various colour depths, 
				 alpha channels, colour profiles and optional data compression.
