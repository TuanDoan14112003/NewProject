            The parallax scrolling effect is a design in which the background image moves at a different speed then the content at the front while scrolling down on the website. This results in a 3D effect as it adds a sense of depth as the human eye perceives objects further away as if they were moving slower. This creates an optical illusion and immersing the viewer in the website. This effect goes beyond the basic requirement due to the added depth perception and designing the image to stay fixed to the screen when scrolling down.

            We implemented the parallax scrolling effect on the topic.html page linked here:

            We used this video to help code the effect:

            The text trail effect is a design where the text is printed several times but each time it is slightly below the last text. Each text is on a timer to appear and then disappear to create the bouncing effect. It is another optical illusion as it looks as if there is one printed text moving up and down. Each text is a different colour to create a rainbow effect.

            We implemented the text trail effect on the index.html page linked here:

            We used this video and code found online to help code the effect:
