					<h2>TIFF - .tiff / .tif</h2>

					<p>
						Short for tagged image file format, it was created in 1986 by the Aldus Corporation (now
						absorbed
						into
						Adobe
						Inc)
						to create a common file used for scanned images (i.e., documents).
						It is a lossless compressed image file with RGB and CMYK support for up to 32 bits per colour
						component
						which in
						turn makes it ideal for printing,
						however it does take up more space as a result.

					<h2>HEIF - .HEIC</h2>

					<p>
						Short for High Efficiency Image Format, it is the file format given to Apple devices that is
						used when taking photos. It was created by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) in 2015. It 
                        is an alternative to JPEG that uses old and modern compression to shrink file format to storage sizes
						below JPEG, whilst keeping similar image quality.

					<h2>GIF .gif</h2>

					<p>
						Short for Graphics interchange format,
						it was created in 1987 by Steve Wilhite as a lossless raster image file that can store small
						animations as well by combining images or frames together. It supports 8 bits per pixel and
                        contain 256 indexed colours.

					<h2>BMP - .bmp</h2>

					<p>
						Short for Microsoft Windows Bitmap format, BMP is a raster graphics image format designed to 
                        store bitmap digital images independently of display devices. Created in 1995 by Microsoft, 
                        it is a large, raw, high quality image format that supports various colour depths, alpha channels, 
                        colour profiles and optional data compression.
